# Search Inside

This project is designed to provide a search engine on pages and medias of EPFL's WordPress inside websites.

Index notes
-----------

* The index data is stored inside the Elastic image.
* In production, the Elastic image is rebuilt every night (by a Tekton Pipeline triggered by a CronJob).
